Community communication channels
================================

As a community, we use various platforms and channels to drive our communications:

1. `Discourse <https://discourse.jupyter.org>`_, which we use for online discussions and more
    long-lived interactions. Everyone in the Jupyter community is welcome to bring ideas and questions there.
2. `Gitter <https://gitter.im>`_, which we use for online and real-time text chats. Gitter is the platform of choice
    for more ephemeral discussions.The primary Gitter channel for JupyterHub is `jupyterhub/jupyterhub <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_.
    
.. note:: Gitter is not archived or searchable. We,therefore, recommend going to Discourse first 
    to post any discussions or questions to increase their usefulness and accessibility to the community.
    Also, remember that our community is distributed across the world in various timezones, so be patient if you do not get an answer immediately!

3. `GitHub issues <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues> _` are used
    for most long-form project discussions, bug reports and feature requests.
        - Issues related to a specific authenticator or spawner should be directed to the appropriate repository for the 
        authenticator or spawner. 
        - If you are using a specific JupyterHub distribution (such as `Zero to JupyterHub on Kubernetes <http://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s>`_
        or `The Littlest JupyterHub <http://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/>`_), you should open issues directly in their repository. 
        - If you cannot find a repository to open your issue in, do not worry! Create it in the `main JupyterHub repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/>`_ and our
        community will help you figure it out.

4. A `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter>`_ for all of Project Jupyter exists, along with one for `teaching with Jupyter
    <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education>`_.
